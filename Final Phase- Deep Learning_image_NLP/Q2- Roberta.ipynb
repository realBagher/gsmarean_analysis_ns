But if you do manage to unearth one, Bergensten teases you can use it to \\u201cfly past the bad guys who are all shooting you with surprisingly bad accuracy, swoop down and land flawlessly into a strategically placed boat and then paddle away at moderately high speeds with the stolen prize pig in the back.\\u201d \",\n          \"Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel has been released from a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility and will return to practice, according to multiple reports. ESPN and the Associated Press, citing anonymous sources, report that the 22-year-old Heisman Trophy winner is expected to start off-season workouts later this month. Manziel entered treatment at the end of January following his rookie season in the NFL. Browns left tackle Joe Thomas told ESPN this week that Manziel had lost the trust of his teammates through his behavior, but Thomas added that Manziel checking himself into rehab was a \\u201creally positive\\u201d step. Manziel will compete with veteran Josh McCown for the QB job this year. \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping when we come back in April we see a new Johnny and everybody\\u2019s blown away with his commitment,\\u201d said Thomas. \\u201cAnd I think he\\u2019s got the talent, so it\\u2019s just a matter of if he commits himself to it, we can have a really good quarterback on our hands.\\u201d \",\n          \"Mac users, rejoice: Apple has fixed one of the things that has been most annoying you about your computer.

In addition to the governor\\u2019s race and house races, Michigan voters were also weighing Proposal 3, a ballot initiative to amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights. She began to see otherwise apolitical friends supporting the ballot measure on Instagram. Still, even as McMorrow remained confident about some Democrats\\u2019 chances in Michigan, the conventional wisdom was that Democrats were facing an uphill battle due to a sluggish economy and a sour national mood. But on Tuesday, Michigan voters not only overwhelmingly approved Proposal 3, they also re-elected Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, along with other Democratic women statewide officials like Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. They re-elected Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who was defending a vulnerable Democratic seat. And in a surprise even to officials like McMorrow, they delivered Democrats not only the state senate, but the state house as well. \\u201cI did not expect that we would get a trifecta,\\u201d says McMorrow. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think any polling captured how angry and energized people still were.\\u201d State rep. Darrin Camilleri, a Democrat who won a seat in the state senate Tuesday night, says that after knocking on 130,000 doors, he thinks abortion was the deciding factor in turning Michigan deep blue. \\u201cIt drove turnout in ways that we did not expect,\\u201d he says.  What happened in Michigan was just the most visible example of a phenomenon that reverberated across the country since the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in June to overturn half a century of abortion rights. Voters who supported reproductive freedom turned out for Democrats in the midterms, blunting what was widely expected to be a Republican wave. Abortion came in a close second to inflation as voters\\u2019 most important issue, according to NBC News exit polls, with 76% of Democrats listing abortion as their top concern. Among women voters, white college educated voters, early voters, and Latino voters, abortion was their number one issue, according to the NBC exit polls. More than 6 in 10 voters\\u2014 including 27% of Republicans\\u2014 said they were dissatisfied with the Supreme Court\\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\u2019s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. And while it may be days until there is solid data on youth turnout, veteran pollster John Della Volpe says his surveys showed that young women and college students boosted their enthusiasm in the aftermath of Dobbs, potentially enough to offset the conservative voters in older generations in certain races. Read More: Here Are the Latest Updates on Midterm Election Results The emphasis on abortion put Republicans on the defensive in key statewide races like Pennsylvania, while boosting Democrats\\u2019 chances in tight congressional districts they had expected to lose. \\u201cDemocrats defied the laws of political gravity last night in the best way,\\u201d says McKenzie Wilson, communications director for progressive data firm Data for Progress. \\u201cAnd clearly the Dobbs decision was the fundamental reason why.\\u201d That led to big wins for reproductive rights, both in political races and in votes where the rights themselves were on the ballot. In all five states with abortion-related ballot referendums on Nov. 8, the abortion-rights position was on track to win clear victories, even in deep-red states. In addition to Michigan, voters struck down an amendment in Kentucky that would infringe on abortion rights, and are on track to do the same in Montana. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re the anti-abortion movement and you can\\u2019t win a vote like that in Kentucky, the question is can you win a vote like that anywhere?\\u201d says Mary Ziegler, a professor at UC Davis School of Law who has written four books about the politics of abortion. The timing of the Supreme Court\\u2019s Dobbs decision meant that Republicans \\u201cwere dealt a bad hand politically,\\u201d says Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. \\u201cThe abortion issue really helped Democrats at a time when there wasn\\u2019t much out there to stoke voter interest in voting for their party.\\u201d After the Dobbs decision, Republicans have passed a cascade of abortion restrictions around the country that limit the procedure in some states to six weeks of pregnancy, sometimes with very limited exceptions. The Dobbs decision and ensuing fallout allowed Democrats to make the case that the GOP was extreme on abortion, sometimes limiting the procedure even in cases of rape and incest\\u2014a highly unpopular position rejected by a wide majority of voters. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a limit to what voters will accept,\\u201d says Democratic strategist Tyler Law.  In Michigan, that meant the battle to protect reproductive rights has delivered Democrats unified control of a state Donald Trump won in 2016 for the first time in almost 40 years. \\u201cThis is an entirely new state for the first time in our lifetime,\\u201d says McMorrow. \\u201cThis felt like the \\u2018do not mess with those women from Michigan\\u2019 campaign.\\u201d \",\n          \"These Are the Best Jobs You Can Do In Your Pajamas. where much of the work is conducted remotely anyway \\u2014 turn up, but there are also jobs in healthcare, education and even the nonprofit sector that extend telecommuting benefits. Positions in sales, finance or HR also can provide opportunity for telecommuting. \\u201cI think something that will surprise job candidates looking for executive-level telecommuting jobs is the number of large and well-known employers offering them,\\u201d says Sara Sutton Fell, CEO of FlexJobs. \\u201cCompanies of all sizes hire for telecommuting jobs even at the highest levels of leadership,\\u201d she says.  For instance, there\\u2019s an academic employer looking for a director of research is happy to have a full-time telecommuter step into the role, and a big national firm is looking to fill a senior vice president of managed travel position that will require logging plenty of frequent-flier miles but can otherwise be performed from home. Don\\u2019t be fooled into thinking that only low-level positions are eligible for telecommuting. \\u201cA typical telecommuter is 49 years old, college educated, and in a management or professional role,\\u201d FlexJobs says. One vice president of consulting gig wants candidates with 15 years experience \\u2014 at minimum. A VP-level sales job requires 10 years of management experience, plus another decade focusing specifically on project management. And even though working from home means saving on gas, parking and/or public transportation tickets, these jobs don\\u2019t pay peanuts. FlexJobs says three-quarters of people who work from home pull down $65,000 a year or more. Not only does letting people work from home let companies extend their talent search beyond driving distance of the office, but there\\u2019s a growing pile of research that suggests people are both happier and more productive when they have the option to lead conference calls in a bathrobe at least part of the time. But if you think there might be perks to working in your PJs, you might need to make your case during an interview, Fell says. If a job ad says telecommuting is limited or available on a case-by-case basis, \\u201cThe job candidate should prepare him or herself to make a case as to why they\\u2019re both an excellent fit for the job, and an excellent fit for telecommuting as well,\\u201d Fell says. And if you score a job where you\\u2019re trading in your briefcase for bunny slippers, the lack of face-to-face interaction also puts the onus on you to be proactive and straightforward in their communication style, she adds. \\u201cJob candidates who are interested in working remotely need to hone their communication skills [and] their ability to set goals for themselves and their teams.\\u201d \",\n          \"Abby Wambach: 'Truth Will Come Out' Behind Drunk Driving Arrest.

Manziel entered treatment at the end of January following his rookie season in the NFL. Browns left tackle Joe Thomas told ESPN this week that Manziel had lost the trust of his teammates through his behavior, but Thomas added that Manziel checking himself into rehab was a \\u201creally positive\\u201d step.

There\\u2019s never a good time for TV companies to offend advertisers but, in a week in which media companies have seen Wall Street fears for their business model wipe tens of billions of dollars off their value, Time Warner Inc\\u2019s CNN hardly needed this. Kenya is pulling out of a contract with the channel after taking offense at being called a \\u2018hotbed of terror\\u2019 during CNN\\u2019s new coverage of President Barack Obama\\u2019s recent visit to Africa. (Obama himself had hardly pulled his punches while in the country, slamming its corruption, its repression of homosexuals and its poor treatment of women.) According to the website Business Daily Africa, the Kenyan Tourism Board, a state agency that markets its internationally renowned safari and beach holidays, said it was reacting to \\u201cmisrepresentation of the country\\u2019s status.\\u201d \\u201cSome narrative adverts were already running on CNN as we planned launch of above-the-line TV campaigns with them but we suspended all of that,\\u201d BDA quoted chief executive Muriithi Ndegwa as saying on Thursday. Tourism Secretary Phyllis Kandie had engaged CNN on a one-year deal to help revive a sector that is struggling after a surge in political instability over the last couple of years. The trouble is, Kenya\\u2019s problems with terrorism-like the beauty of its tourist attractions\\u2013are all too real. Flag carrier Kenyan Airways posted the country\\u2019s biggest ever corporate loss two weeks ago, on the back of a 25% year-on-year drop in tourist arrivals in the first five months of the year. Tourist visits, a key source of foreign exchange for the country, have fallen for the last three years running (although the Kenyan Shilling has fared a lot better against a resurgent dollar than many other emerging currencies in that time). The Somalia-based Islamic terrorist group Al Shabaab has contributed much to that, having launched a string of attacks inside Kenya since 2012 in response to Kenya\\u2019s deployment of troops in neighboring Somalia. A 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya\\u2019s capital Nairobi by Al Shabaab-associated gunmen killed 130 people, grabbing global headlines. In an even more gruesome attack this April, terrorists killed 148 people, mainly students, at the Garissa University College.

Her acute respiratory distress syndrome puts her at a high risk for dangerous complications related to COVID-19, compelling her to take quarantine seriously. So when the 39-year-old read Alabama\\u2019s requirements for voting by mail this election cycle, she was stunned. While Alabamians no longer needed to give a reason for requesting a mail-in absentee ballot, they still need to either have their mail ballot notarized or witnessed by two adults simultaneously, as well as include a copy of their photo ID when applying for the ballot. Lux lives alone with her 17-year-old son, and suddenly faced an impossible choice: either risk COVID-19 exposure at a notary service or and allow two adults into her home to witness her ballot. \\u201cMy reaction [was], \\u2018Wow, really? You\\u2019re going to do this to me?\\u2019\\u201d she says. \\u201cI just can\\u2019t risk it. It\\u2019s life and death that we\\u2019re talking about here\\u2026 Why should I jump through all these hoops?\\u201d  Lux considered other options, including curbside voting, which many states have adopted this year amid COVID-19. But while Alabama law does not prohibit the service, the state has gone to great lengths to prevent counties from offering it this year. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said explicitly that curbside voting would not be allowed under the state\\u2019s law. On Oct. 21, the Supreme Court ruled that Alabama\\u2019s de facto ban on curbside voting could stand, reversing a lower court\\u2019s ruling that the restriction violated the Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was the latest instance of a conservative court upholding Republican-backed voting restrictions in the final weeks before Election Day. That court decision, combined with Alabama\\u2019s requirements that mail ballots be notarized or witnessed, and include a copy of an ID with the application, collectively create an extremely high burden to vote amid the pandemic\\u2014particularly for disabled, elderly and other high-risk people.  \\u201cAlabama voters are going to have to decide whether they want to vote in person or not vote at all because some of them will have a very difficult time complying with the absentee ballot requirements,\\u201d says Sarah H. Brannon, a managing attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\\u2019s (ACLU) Voting Rights Project, which helped bring the suit against Alabama\\u2019s rules.  In May, several Alabama voters challenged the state\\u2019s de facto ban on curbside voting, as well as its witness and voter ID requirements, arguing that the rules posed a threat to their health. In September, a federal district court agreed with the plaintiffs, ordering Alabama to allow curbside voting and suspending the witness and ID rules for elderly voters or those with underlying medical conditions. Alabama appealed the case and earlier this month, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals handed Alabama Republicans the victory: the appellate court reversed the lower court decision, reinstating the witness and ID requirements.  The court drama continued. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling left open the option that counties could offer curbside voting, and two of the state\\u2019s most populous counties\\u2014Jefferson County and Montgomery County\\u2014took steps to implement the service. But Alabama appealed again and the Supreme Court decided in its favor. Curbside voting will not be an option for Alabama voters this year. After the prolonged litigation battle, Alabama voters who are disabled, elderly or have underlying conditions were back where they started: deciding whether to put their health at risk to fulfill the witness and ID requirements or vote in person\\u2014or not vote at all. \\u201cNobody should have to make a decision between being able to vote and protecting yourself from COVID-19,\\u201d says Michelle Bishop, voting rights specialist at the National Disability Rights Network. Lux, who is legally blind, is a member of the disability rights advocate group People First of Alabama, the plaintiff in the suit, and testified in the trial. \\u201cI know if I\\u2019m affected by it, there are thousands others like me affected,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fight for social justice.\\u201d Read More: Here\\u2019s Everything You Need to Know About Voting Americans with disabilities and chronic illnesses have already been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And as they prepared to vote this year, many found that their states\\u2019 procedures did not take into account their needs, prompting cases like this around the country. Voters with disabilities sued in North Carolina, Virginia and Texas, and advocates sued South Carolina over a witness requirement for absentee ballots in that state. In Alabama, where coronavirus cases have been on the rise, the issue is particularly acute. The state has a history of voter suppression and a high proportion of Black and disabled voters, all of whom are disproportionately affected by both the pandemic and voting rights issues. There are 748,000 eligible voters with disabilities in Alabama, representing 20% of the state\\u2019s electorate, according to data from researchers Douglas Kruse and Lisa Schur at Rutgers University. Alabama\\u2019s population is among the highest risk for heart disease, stroke and has the highest rate of diabetes in the country. Over 40% of its coronavirus deaths have been people with diabetes. Many high-risk voters are taking the threat seriously. Tonja Leath, 57, usually votes by mail from her home in Hoover, Ala. because of a disability that makes it difficult for her to stand for long periods of time. But when she realized she would still need to fulfill the witness and photo ID requirements during the pandemic, she was frustrated. \\u201cWhy with this election? It does not make any sense. They\\u2019re inconveniencing people, especially the disabled and the elderly,\\u201d she says. Leath says she wishes her county offered curbside voting. In Montgomery, 37-year-old Terri Flowers has also been trying to stay home because her daughter has asthma. Flowers has decided to have her daughter attend school virtually for the foreseeable future to protect her from any exposure to the virus. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m going to keep her from going to school because of [the virus],\\u201d she says, \\u201cit doesn\\u2019t make sense for me to go out and be exposed to COVID and potentially bring it back to her.\\u201d  To avoid concerns about voting by mail, both Leath and Flowers decided to vote \\u201cin-person absentee,\\u201d a process that allowed them to go to their absentee ballot manager\\u2019s office, apply for an absentee ballot in person, fill out their absentee ballot and then have it notarized. While they made their situations work, not all voters will be able to do so, as the method still requires voters to risk COVID-19 exposure at their absentee ballot manager\\u2019s office, which can be difficult to access for disabled or rural voters. The other state requirement for voting by mail\\u2014that Alabama residents include a copy of their photo ID in their ballot application\\u2014can also present obstacles for lower income voters who might not have regular internet access or printers at home. Alabama argued that the laws in question were necessary to prevent voter fraud and preserve confidence in the upcoming election. It also said that the restrictions did not place an undue burden on the plaintiffs. \\u201cThe photo ID and witness requirements are necessary deterrents for those looking to commit voter fraud, and I am glad the 11th Circuit has recognized their importance in safeguarding the elections process,\\u201d Merrill said in an Oct. 13 statement. Evidence has repeatedly shown that voter fraud in the U.S. is nearly nonexistent.  Caren Short, a senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which jointly filed the suit against Alabama, says the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling allowing the vote-by-mail laws to stand \\u201cdemonstrates part of a trend where unfortunately more conservative state election officials are leaning heavily on the myth of voter fraud to justify onerous and unnecessary restrictions on voting to essentially suppress votes.\\u201d  Maia Fleischman, a voting rights fellow with the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), which also jointly filed the suit, adds that while she found the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling disappointing, it \\u201cpretty much aligned with what we\\u2019ve been seeing in the courts the last month.\\u201d She said that, in her opinion, the group chose not to appeal the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling on the absentee ballot laws after looking at how the Supreme Court has ruled in similar voting rights cases this year. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t also want to make things harder for voting rights cases in the future,\\u201d she says. She added, \\u201cWe decided to focus our on the argument that the curbside voting ban is unconstitutional and it is a proper ADA accommodation. We think curbside voting would have benefited thousands of Alabamians this upcoming election day in light of COVID-19.\\u201d The Supreme Court did not offer an opinion explaining its decision to stay the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling this week, and only the three liberal justices dissented. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\u2019s death last month, the Supreme Court now has a conservative majority, and if President Donald Trump\\u2019s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed as expected, that will cement the court\\u2019s rightward tilt. Trump has also appointed roughly a quarter of all federal appeals court judges during his time in office, meaning that cases are now more likely to be heard by conservative judges on appeal.  Disability and voting rights advocates say that impact of a conservative-leaning bench will affect civil rights litigation long past Nov. 3. \\u201cWe have to file cases at the trial level, because voting is a constitutional right and the foundation of our democracy,\\u201d says Christina Brandt-Young, a managing attorney at Disability Rights Advocates, which signed onto an amicus brief in the Alabama case. \\u201cBut if appeals are less and less attractive, that will push us back into other kinds of advocacy.\\u201d After much deliberation, Lux was able to vote this year. She found a notary who was willing to come to her house, wear a mask, and certify her ballot, so she didn\\u2019t have to risk a trip to the county elections office. She\\u2019s since mailed her ballot and received a notification that it was received. But the process left a bitter taste in her mouth. \\u201cI feel marginalized,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being swept under the rug.\\u201d She also recognizes that many voters won\\u2019t be able to find the same work-around like she did. As Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in her dissent on the high court\\u2019s ruling, one of the plaintiffs, Howard Porter, Jr.\\u2014a Black man in his 70s with both asthma and Parkinson\\u2019s Disease\\u2014described the state voting restrictions as a question of life or death.  \\u201c\\u2018[S]o many of my [ancestors] even died to vote,\\u201d Porter testified before the lower court. \\u201cAnd while I don\\u2019t mind dying to vote, I think we\\u2019re past that\\u2014we\\u2019re past that time.\\u2019\\u201d  \",\n          \"How Elise Stefanik Went From Moderate to MAGA.

As soon as next week, she is widely expected to ascend to the position of House GOP conference chair, which would make her the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress. And she will have gotten there by lashing herself to a cause that undermines the same democratic process she once hoped to strengthen.  The opening for Stefanik to become the No. 3 House Republican has been created by the anticipated ouster of Rep. Liz Cheney, who has lost the support of her colleagues for insisting the party stop parroting President Donald Trump\\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Rejecting Trump\\u2019s fictions about a stolen election is enough to make Cheney, a rock-ribbed conservative and daughter of a former vice president, an outcast in today\\u2019s GOP. \\u201cElise Stefanik is a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair,\\u201d Trump said in a statement. To replace Cheney with Stefanik would send a powerful signal: that anyone who refuses to carry water for Trump\\u2019s conspiracy theories cannot carry the Republican mantle.  But Elise Stefanik is no Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene. She was not always a MAGA warrior. Not long ago, she was a widely respected moderate Republican known for her embrace of facts, her trust in science and her push to build a more diverse party, highlighted by her successful efforts to recruit more GOP women to run for office. She was a prominent member of the moderate Tuesday Group, a caucus of center-right Republicans. And she was widely credited for a bipartisan spirit\\u2014\\u201devery Democrat\\u2019s favorite Republican,\\u201d as one former aide to GOP leadership puts it now. Yet over the last five years, Trump has redefined the GOP. Today the party primarily judges its representatives not by any particular policy positions but by their allegiance to a defeated President and an embrace of his conspiracy theories. Stefanik has adapted. It\\u2019s a calculation that has made her a fundraising star and a party leader-in-waiting. It\\u2019s also dismayed many Republicans who have worked with and admired her in the past.  \\u201cTo be a handmaiden of Trump and get a little pat on the head from Trump is not a leadership move,\\u201d says former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA), who worked closely with Stefanik and helped organize a small, bipartisan shower in her honor ahead of her 2017 wedding. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing. It\\u2019s sad.\\u201d So how did Elise Stefanik go from praising the democratic process to standing on the House floor in the aftermath of the Capitol riot and voting to object to the Electoral College results? How did she go from saying that one particular Republican candidate was \\u201cdisqualifying themselves with untruthful statements\\u201d in 2015 to feeding vague conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden on Steve Bannon\\u2019s podcast in 2021? Her evolution mirrors the transformation of her party, while her rise within its ranks is a fall from the modern, millennial conservatism she once was on track to define.  Stefanik\\u2019s office declined to make her available to comment for this story, which is based on interviews with former colleagues, aides, friends, classmates and mentors, and draws on others I conducted with Stefanik in 2018 and 2019 for my book, The Ones We\\u2019ve Been Waiting For. Stefanik\\u2019s embrace of Trump has disappointed her high school teachers, alienated her from her alma mater and puzzled former allies and mentors who envisioned a different future for her.  \\u201cElise could have been the face of a new generation of Republicans that could represent a real big-tent party, that could build beyond the base, that could lay the foundation for a coalition that could win elections nationally,\\u201d says Margaret Hoover, a center-right commentator who worked with Stefanik at the Bush White House and now hosts PBS\\u2019s Firing Line. \\u201cIt shows that she was never motivated by principles, and that\\u2019s deeply disappointing.\\u201d Now, as her tolerance of baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election propels her toward Republican leadership, many of the people who knew her in the past are asking: what happened to Elise Stefanik? If you ask Stefanik\\u2019s childhood classmates what she was like as a girl, two words keep coming up: \\u201cintegrity\\u201d and \\u201cambition.\\u201d Growing up in upstate New York, Stefanik was friendly with Melissa DeRosa, now an embattled senior aide to scandal-plagued Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo. Both served in student government at the Albany Academy for Girls. In middle school they teamed up to pressure administrators to install a snack machine.  DeRosa grew into one of New York\\u2019s most powerful Democratic operatives as Stefanik climbed the GOP ladder. But despite their political differences, they remained close for a while. DeRosa was one of a handful of old classmates at Stefanik\\u2019s 2017 wedding. When I interviewed her about Stefanik two years ago for my book, DeRosa told me the old friends would frequently commiserate about the rough-and-tumble world of New York politics.  \\u201cThere have been times over the years when I have called her, practically in tears, saying, \\u2018This just happened, I feel so beaten down, I don\\u2019t know what to do anymore,\\u2019\\u201d DeRosa told me back then. \\u201cAnd she is so morally supportive and will be there to coach through whatever the issue is.\\u201d Somewhere along the way, Stefanik also learned to interpret criticism as evidence that she was doing something right, according to DeRosa. \\u201cShe says, \\u2018People who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you\\u2019re doing a good job,\\u201d DeRosa recalled. \\u201cHer attitude has been like: \\u2018Dig in and go the other way.\\u2019\\u201d But in February of 2021, as DeRosa took heat for the Cuomo Administration\\u2019s alleged effort to obscure the number of nursing-home deaths from COVID-19 in New York, Stefanik went nuclear. On one occasion, she tweeted that the scandal enmeshing her friend of 20 years was a \\u201ccriminal coverup,\\u201d On another, she linked to a story about about Cuomo\\u2019s senior aides, adding \\u201cPROSECUTE NOW!\\u201d  \\u201cShe sort of threw Melissa under the bus,\\u201d says Caroline Mason, the former headmistress at Albany Academy for Girls, who says she kept in touch with Stefanik for years after she graduated, exchanged Christmas cards with her until last year, and even helped preside over her 2017 wedding ceremony. Mason said she had long admired Stefanik, but that \\u201csomething stronger took hold of her.\\u201d  \\u201cShe basically abandoned her own core values for a man who had no core values,\\u201d Mason says. \\u201cHer fealty to Trump seems to have trumped her fealty to her sisters in the House.\\u201d  After high school, Stefanik went to Harvard, becoming the first in her immediate family to earn a college degree. Stefanik was one of few conservative women at Harvard\\u2019s Institute of Politics, but fellow campus politicos told me they admired her sharp reasoning, intellectual integrity and willingness to stick to her positions, even when they were unpopular on a liberal-leaning campus. She crossed paths there with Pete Buttigieg, now the U.S. Transportation Secretary, and they even met for coffee once. (Stefanik and Buttigieg both say their coffee was purely platonic, but the rumor on campus was that it was a single, uneventful date; while Buttigieg is now married to a man, he dated women in college. \\u201cPeter and Elise were at Harvard at the same time and were friends in college and once went to coffee,\\u201d a Stefanik spokesperson said. \\u201cThey did not date.\\u201d )  From Harvard, Stefanik rocketed through the traditional Republican establishment. She worked in various roles in the George W. Bush White House, then as an adviser to vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan during the 2012 presidential campaign. After that defeat, the GOP released an autopsy that argued the GOP was struggling to reach young voters, women and voters of color. Stefanik saw it as an opening to help transform her party. With support from Ryan and deep-pocketed donors, she handily won her seat in New York\\u2019s North Country to become the youngest woman elected to Congress in U.S. history. (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has since beaten that record.) When she arrived on the Hill, Stefanik was part of a cohort of young Republicans focused on helping the GOP appeal to younger, more diverse voters. With Ryan as her mentor, she staked out moderate positions on climate change and immigration consistent with her fellow conservative millennials, and pushed the GOP to recruit more women to run for office. She also built a strong record of bipartisanship. Stefanik was the 31st most bipartisan members of Congress in her first term and 19th in her second term, according to an index compiled by Georgetown University\\u2019s Lugar Center.  Stefanik tended to steer clear of hot-button right-wing issues, focusing instead on those that affected her district, like military funding and support for rural farmers. She voted against Trump\\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement\\u2014the 2017 tax cuts\\u2014because she felt they unfairly penalized high-tax states like New York. In 2017, she introduced a House resolution to commit to addressing climate change, calling environmental stewardship a \\u201cconservative principle.\\u201d  This relatively moderate record didn\\u2019t make her especially popular with Republican hard-liners. As Stefanik emerged in recent days as a top candidate to replace Cheney, the president of the conservative Club for Growth called her \\u201cvery much a liberal.\\u201d Other conservative groups, from Heritage Action to the American Conservative Union, have ranked Cheney\\u2019s record as more conservative than Stefanik\\u2019s.  But Stefanik was cultivating a reputation among colleagues as a rising star. \\u201cShe had developed a really good brand: she was the young, smart, vivacious millennial who could appeal to constituencies that Republicans had difficulty with,\\u201d says a former GOP congressman who worked closely with Stefanik. \\u201cShe had that real up-and-coming thing.\\u201d When Trump first emerged as a political phenomenon, Stefanik mostly ignored him. She said she would \\u201csupport my party\\u2019s nominee\\u201d in the 2016 election, but largely avoided mentioning him by name. From time to time, she carefully spoke out against him, adopting a tone of dutiful scolding. In August 2015, she said in a radio interview that Trump had been \\u201cinsulting to women\\u201d and said his campaign had \\u201churt the effort\\u201d to reach out to them. After Trump\\u2019s Access Hollywood scandal, she said his \\u201cinappropriate, offensive comments are just wrong.\\u201d When Trump moved to ban travel from some Muslim-majority countries, she said she opposed his \\u201crushed and overly broad Executive Order.\\u201d She said she didn\\u2019t think his plans for a border wall were \\u201crealistic\\u201d and that the President \\u201cwasn\\u2019t exactly right on that.\\u201d When Trump blasted immigrants from \\u201csh-thole countries,\\u201d Stefanik released a statement that the comments were \\u201cwrong and contrary to our American ideals.\\u201d  But as Trump\\u2019s presidency wore on, Stefanik\\u2019s party transformed. So did her district, which voted twice for Obama before breaking heavily for Trump. \\u201cIt\\u2019s only become more and more supportive of President Trump over time,\\u201d Stefanik said on Bannon\\u2019s podcast. \\u201cI represent farmers, manufacturers, and hardworking families who want someone who stands up for them, and President Trump spoke to those people.\\u201d  \\u201cIf you\\u2019re looking for a through line, it\\u2019s that her district has changed and she\\u2019s always been attuned to what her district wants,\\u201d says Brendan Buck, a former top aide to Speaker Ryan. \\u201cA swing purple district got a middle-of-the-road moderate member, and now it is a Trumpy district, and they have a Trumpy representative.\\u201d  It\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when Stefanik\\u2019s own evolution began. Some suspect it started in August of 2018, when Trump joined Stefanik for a visit to Fort Drum, a key military base in her district. \\u201cYou\\u2019re standing in front of a crowd, and all of a sudden you see there\\u2019s a bigger crowd than you normally would have,\\u201d says one former Republican Congresswoman who recalled that event.  Others point out that the political downsides of anti-Trumpism became clear around the same time. In the 2018 midterms, many Republicans who had criticized Trump lost their seats. Among them was Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a close friend of Stefanik\\u2019s who had been outspoken in his opposition to Trump\\u2019s immigration policy.  Still others see a substantive reason for the change. Stefanik sat on the Intelligence Committee during the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While former FBI chief Robert Mueller found widespread evidence of bad behavior by Trump and others, including repeated testimony showing Trump obstructed justice, the Intelligence Committee, and later the Department of Justice Inspector General, found evidence of inappropriate investigative measures by the FBI and others. Over the course of the Russia probe, Stefanik became an outspoken defender of the President, arguing that he was being unfairly persecuted by Democrats. \\u201cThe longer she served on Intelligence, the more she pivoted towards defending the Administration,\\u201d says a former GOP member of Congress. Then came Trump\\u2019s 2019 impeachment trial on charges he solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. That\\u2019s when a switch flipped, according to a former aide to GOP House leadership. Stefanik was named a member of Trump\\u2019s impeachment defense team and emerged as a vehement advocate, earning favorable press on Fox News and praise from the President himself. \\u201cShe became a darling of the right and an enemy of the left,\\u201d says a former Republican Congressman who knew her well. \\u201cAnd she just decided to own that and monetized it.\\u201d  In the last three months of 2019, Stefanik raised a whopping $3.2 million\\u2014a seven-fold increase from the previous quarter\\u2019s haul\\u2014making her the second-highest fundraiser in the House. She had picked her side. \\u201cShe has become a star,\\u201d Trump gushed on Fox \u0026 Friends. Stefanik soon became the co-chair of Trump\\u2019s re-election campaign in New York. She gave a rousing speech at the 2020 GOP Convention about \\u201cthe Democrats\\u2019 baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media\\u2019s endless obsession with it.\\u201d  \\u201cThis attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you: your voice, and your vote,\\u201d she added. \\u201cOur support for President Trump is stronger than ever before.\\u201d This would be the basis of her defense of Trump before, during, and after the 2020 election. Her constituents were Trump\\u2019s voters, and they perceived any attack on Trump to be an attack on them. \\u201cI think all of this is very genuine to her,\\u201d says Anthony Pileggi, a former top aide for Stefanik from the beginning of her Congressional career. \\u201cI think this is someone who is a very hardworking member of Congress, who saw that the president was being attacked during impeachment.\\u201d Others see it differently. \\u201cTrump has won the Republican Party. Trump owns it. It is the key to her re-elections, it is the key to her fundraising, it\\u2019s the key to her advancement within Congress,\\u201d says Hoover. \\u201cShe knows how to play it, so that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. Never mind that it\\u2019s undermining democracy. She\\u2019s made a calculation that she can rise to power by backing the Big Lie.\\u201d  In the aftermath of Biden\\u2019s victory in the 2020 election, Stefanik stopped short of adopting Trump\\u2019s false claims that the election was \\u201crigged\\u2019 or \\u201cstolen.\\u201d But she perpetuated the baseless claims around the election outcome.  In a Newsmax interview a month after the election, she parroted conspiracy theories about \\u201cirregularities,\\u201d then mentioned she had \\u201cconcerns\\u201d about \\u201cDominion software,\\u201d indirectly alluding to a false conspiracy theory that the voting-machine company had been part of an effort to rig the election against Trump. (Officials from Trump\\u2019s Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that \\u201cthere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\\u201d and Dominion has filed several lawsuits against people and organizations that spread the conspiracy theory, including one that forced Newsmax to retract its claims and apologize.) In December, Stefanik was one of 126 Republicans who signed onto an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to consider rejecting election results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. She then announced in an open letter to her constituents that she would object to electors from the same four states. Amid the insurrection, when House Republicans forced a vote on only two states, Stefanik voted to certify Biden\\u2019s win in Arizona but reject his win in Pennsylvania. She continued to make baseless claims about \\u201cvoting irregularities\\u201d and \\u201clack of ballot integrity and security,\\u201d though no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud ever emerged. (Harvard, her beloved alma mater, stripped her from the Senior Advisory Council of the Institute of Politics after she voted to challenge the election results.) Some people who know Stefanik said she may have cultivated genuine concerns about election integrity, given that votes were cast under the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic and the race was extremely close in some states. On Bannon\\u2019s podcast, she said she was concerned about \\u201cunprecedented, unconstitutional overreach\\u201d and \\u201cunelected judges and bureaucrats who were rewriting election laws in real time,\\u201d and raised questions about a \\u201clack of chain of custody\\u201d for ballots. Her aides say she is simply representing the concerns of the millions of Americans who don\\u2019t believe the election was fair, including her constituents, who voted for Trump by a wide margin. But no one I spoke to inside or outside her office believes she actually thinks the election was stolen. When asked directly, aides often pivot to \\u201cconcerns\\u201d about \\u201cirregularities.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t even know if she believes the Big Lie,\\u201d says Hoover, Stefanik\\u2019s former colleague. \\u201cBut she is absolutely responsible for propagating a lie that will undermine our democracy.\\u201d  Whether she believes the lies or not, Stefanik has now aligned herself with Trump for good. She may still be the face of the GOP\\u2019s future.

There\\u2019s never a good time for TV companies to offend advertisers but, in a week in which media companies have seen Wall Street fears for their business model wipe tens of billions of dollars off their value, Time Warner Inc\\u2019s CNN hardly needed this. Kenya is pulling out of a contract with the channel after taking offense at being called a \\u2018hotbed of terror\\u2019 during CNN\\u2019s new coverage of President Barack Obama\\u2019s recent visit to Africa. (Obama himself had hardly pulled his punches while in the country, slamming its corruption, its repression of homosexuals and its poor treatment of women.) According to the website Business Daily Africa, the Kenyan Tourism Board, a state agency that markets its internationally renowned safari and beach holidays, said it was reacting to \\u201cmisrepresentation of the country\\u2019s status.\\u201d \\u201cSome narrative adverts were already running on CNN as we planned launch of above-the-line TV campaigns with them but we suspended all of that,\\u201d BDA quoted chief executive Muriithi Ndegwa as saying on Thursday. Tourism Secretary Phyllis Kandie had engaged CNN on a one-year deal to help revive a sector that is struggling after a surge in political instability over the last couple of years. The trouble is, Kenya\\u2019s problems with terrorism-like the beauty of its tourist attractions\\u2013are all too real. Flag carrier Kenyan Airways posted the country\\u2019s biggest ever corporate loss two weeks ago, on the back of a 25% year-on-year drop in tourist arrivals in the first five months of the year. Tourist visits, a key source of foreign exchange for the country, have fallen for the last three years running (although the Kenyan Shilling has fared a lot better against a resurgent dollar than many other emerging currencies in that time). The Somalia-based Islamic terrorist group Al Shabaab has contributed much to that, having launched a string of attacks inside Kenya since 2012 in response to Kenya\\u2019s deployment of troops in neighboring Somalia. A 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya\\u2019s capital Nairobi by Al Shabaab-associated gunmen killed 130 people, grabbing global headlines. In an even more gruesome attack this April, terrorists killed 148 people, mainly students, at the Garissa University College.

Her acute respiratory distress syndrome puts her at a high risk for dangerous complications related to COVID-19, compelling her to take quarantine seriously. So when the 39-year-old read Alabama\\u2019s requirements for voting by mail this election cycle, she was stunned. While Alabamians no longer needed to give a reason for requesting a mail-in absentee ballot, they still need to either have their mail ballot notarized or witnessed by two adults simultaneously, as well as include a copy of their photo ID when applying for the ballot. Lux lives alone with her 17-year-old son, and suddenly faced an impossible choice: either risk COVID-19 exposure at a notary service or and allow two adults into her home to witness her ballot. \\u201cMy reaction [was], \\u2018Wow, really?

It\\u2019s life and death that we\\u2019re talking about here\\u2026 Why should I jump through all these hoops?\\u201d  Lux considered other options, including curbside voting, which many states have adopted this year amid COVID-19. But while Alabama law does not prohibit the service, the state has gone to great lengths to prevent counties from offering it this year. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said explicitly that curbside voting would not be allowed under the state\\u2019s law. On Oct. 21, the Supreme Court ruled that Alabama\\u2019s de facto ban on curbside voting could stand, reversing a lower court\\u2019s ruling that the restriction violated the Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was the latest instance of a conservative court upholding Republican-backed voting restrictions in the final weeks before Election Day. That court decision, combined with Alabama\\u2019s requirements that mail ballots be notarized or witnessed, and include a copy of an ID with the application, collectively create an extremely high burden to vote amid the pandemic\\u2014particularly for disabled, elderly and other high-risk people.  \\u201cAlabama voters are going to have to decide whether they want to vote in person or not vote at all because some of them will have a very difficult time complying with the absentee ballot requirements,\\u201d says Sarah H. Brannon, a managing attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\\u2019s (ACLU) Voting Rights Project, which helped bring the suit against Alabama\\u2019s rules.  In May, several Alabama voters challenged the state\\u2019s de facto ban on curbside voting, as well as its witness and voter ID requirements, arguing that the rules posed a threat to their health. In September, a federal district court agreed with the plaintiffs, ordering Alabama to allow curbside voting and suspending the witness and ID rules for elderly voters or those with underlying medical conditions. Alabama appealed the case and earlier this month, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals handed Alabama Republicans the victory: the appellate court reversed the lower court decision, reinstating the witness and ID requirements.  The court drama continued. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling left open the option that counties could offer curbside voting, and two of the state\\u2019s most populous counties\\u2014Jefferson County and Montgomery County\\u2014took steps to implement the service. But Alabama appealed again and the Supreme Court decided in its favor. Curbside voting will not be an option for Alabama voters this year. After the prolonged litigation battle, Alabama voters who are disabled, elderly or have underlying conditions were back where they started: deciding whether to put their health at risk to fulfill the witness and ID requirements or vote in person\\u2014or not vote at all. \\u201cNobody should have to make a decision between being able to vote and protecting yourself from COVID-19,\\u201d says Michelle Bishop, voting rights specialist at the National Disability Rights Network. Lux, who is legally blind, is a member of the disability rights advocate group People First of Alabama, the plaintiff in the suit, and testified in the trial. \\u201cI know if I\\u2019m affected by it, there are thousands others like me affected,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fight for social justice.\\u201d Read More: Here\\u2019s Everything You Need to Know About Voting Americans with disabilities and chronic illnesses have already been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And as they prepared to vote this year, many found that their states\\u2019 procedures did not take into account their needs, prompting cases like this around the country. Voters with disabilities sued in North Carolina, Virginia and Texas, and advocates sued South Carolina over a witness requirement for absentee ballots in that state. In Alabama, where coronavirus cases have been on the rise, the issue is particularly acute. The state has a history of voter suppression and a high proportion of Black and disabled voters, all of whom are disproportionately affected by both the pandemic and voting rights issues. There are 748,000 eligible voters with disabilities in Alabama, representing 20% of the state\\u2019s electorate, according to data from researchers Douglas Kruse and Lisa Schur at Rutgers University. Alabama\\u2019s population is among the highest risk for heart disease, stroke and has the highest rate of diabetes in the country. Over 40% of its coronavirus deaths have been people with diabetes. Many high-risk voters are taking the threat seriously. Tonja Leath, 57, usually votes by mail from her home in Hoover, Ala. because of a disability that makes it difficult for her to stand for long periods of time. But when she realized she would still need to fulfill the witness and photo ID requirements during the pandemic, she was frustrated. \\u201cWhy with this election? It does not make any sense. They\\u2019re inconveniencing people, especially the disabled and the elderly,\\u201d she says. Leath says she wishes her county offered curbside voting. In Montgomery, 37-year-old Terri Flowers has also been trying to stay home because her daughter has asthma. Flowers has decided to have her daughter attend school virtually for the foreseeable future to protect her from any exposure to the virus. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m going to keep her from going to school because of [the virus],\\u201d she says, \\u201cit doesn\\u2019t make sense for me to go out and be exposed to COVID and potentially bring it back to her.\\u201d  To avoid concerns about voting by mail, both Leath and Flowers decided to vote \\u201cin-person absentee,\\u201d a process that allowed them to go to their absentee ballot manager\\u2019s office, apply for an absentee ballot in person, fill out their absentee ballot and then have it notarized. While they made their situations work, not all voters will be able to do so, as the method still requires voters to risk COVID-19 exposure at their absentee ballot manager\\u2019s office, which can be difficult to access for disabled or rural voters. The other state requirement for voting by mail\\u2014that Alabama residents include a copy of their photo ID in their ballot application\\u2014can also present obstacles for lower income voters who might not have regular internet access or printers at home. Alabama argued that the laws in question were necessary to prevent voter fraud and preserve confidence in the upcoming election. It also said that the restrictions did not place an undue burden on the plaintiffs. \\u201cThe photo ID and witness requirements are necessary deterrents for those looking to commit voter fraud, and I am glad the 11th Circuit has recognized their importance in safeguarding the elections process,\\u201d Merrill said in an Oct. 13 statement. Evidence has repeatedly shown that voter fraud in the U.S. is nearly nonexistent.  Caren Short, a senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which jointly filed the suit against Alabama, says the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling allowing the vote-by-mail laws to stand \\u201cdemonstrates part of a trend where unfortunately more conservative state election officials are leaning heavily on the myth of voter fraud to justify onerous and unnecessary restrictions on voting to essentially suppress votes.\\u201d  Maia Fleischman, a voting rights fellow with the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), which also jointly filed the suit, adds that while she found the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling disappointing, it \\u201cpretty much aligned with what we\\u2019ve been seeing in the courts the last month.\\u201d She said that, in her opinion, the group chose not to appeal the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling on the absentee ballot laws after looking at how the Supreme Court has ruled in similar voting rights cases this year. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t also want to make things harder for voting rights cases in the future,\\u201d she says. She added, \\u201cWe decided to focus our on the argument that the curbside voting ban is unconstitutional and it is a proper ADA accommodation. We think curbside voting would have benefited thousands of Alabamians this upcoming election day in light of COVID-19.\\u201d The Supreme Court did not offer an opinion explaining its decision to stay the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling this week, and only the three liberal justices dissented. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\u2019s death last month, the Supreme Court now has a conservative majority, and if President Donald Trump\\u2019s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed as expected, that will cement the court\\u2019s rightward tilt. Trump has also appointed roughly a quarter of all federal appeals court judges during his time in office, meaning that cases are now more likely to be heard by conservative judges on appeal.  Disability and voting rights advocates say that impact of a conservative-leaning bench will affect civil rights litigation long past Nov. 3. \\u201cWe have to file cases at the trial level, because voting is a constitutional right and the foundation of our democracy,\\u201d says Christina Brandt-Young, a managing attorney at Disability Rights Advocates, which signed onto an amicus brief in the Alabama case. \\u201cBut if appeals are less and less attractive, that will push us back into other kinds of advocacy.\\u201d After much deliberation, Lux was able to vote this year. She found a notary who was willing to come to her house, wear a mask, and certify her ballot, so she didn\\u2019t have to risk a trip to the county elections office. She\\u2019s since mailed her ballot and received a notification that it was received. But the process left a bitter taste in her mouth. \\u201cI feel marginalized,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being swept under the rug.\\u201d She also recognizes that many voters won\\u2019t be able to find the same work-around like she did. As Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in her dissent on the high court\\u2019s ruling, one of the plaintiffs, Howard Porter, Jr.\\u2014a Black man in his 70s with both asthma and Parkinson\\u2019s Disease\\u2014described the state voting restrictions as a question of life or death.  \\u201c\\u2018[S]o many of my [ancestors] even died to vote,\\u201d Porter testified before the lower court. \\u201cAnd while I don\\u2019t mind dying to vote, I think we\\u2019re past that\\u2014we\\u2019re past that time.\\u2019\\u201d  \",\n          \"How Elise Stefanik Went From Moderate to MAGA. When Elise Stefanik was elected to the House of Representatives in 2014, she was hailed as the fresh face of the new GOP. Stefanik had run for office in her 20s, determined to modernize the Republican Party to attract more women and appeal to her fellow millennials. In her victory speech, she praised her opponents for their good-faith participation in the miracle of American democracy. \\u201cNo matter their party, our democratic process is strengthened by those individuals willing to put forth their ideas,\\u201d she said on the night she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.  Today Stefanik is still a politician on the rise, but for very different reasons. As soon as next week, she is widely expected to ascend to the position of House GOP conference chair, which would make her the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress. And she will have gotten there by lashing herself to a cause that undermines the same democratic process she once hoped to strengthen.  The opening for Stefanik to become the No. 3 House Republican has been created by the anticipated ouster of Rep. Liz Cheney, who has lost the support of her colleagues for insisting the party stop parroting President Donald Trump\\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Rejecting Trump\\u2019s fictions about a stolen election is enough to make Cheney, a rock-ribbed conservative and daughter of a former vice president, an outcast in today\\u2019s GOP. \\u201cElise Stefanik is a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair,\\u201d Trump said in a statement. To replace Cheney with Stefanik would send a powerful signal: that anyone who refuses to carry water for Trump\\u2019s conspiracy theories cannot carry the Republican mantle.  But Elise Stefanik is no Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene. She was not always a MAGA warrior. Not long ago, she was a widely respected moderate Republican known for her embrace of facts, her trust in science and her push to build a more diverse party, highlighted by her successful efforts to recruit more GOP women to run for office. She was a prominent member of the moderate Tuesday Group, a caucus of center-right Republicans. And she was widely credited for a bipartisan spirit\\u2014\\u201devery Democrat\\u2019s favorite Republican,\\u201d as one former aide to GOP leadership puts it now. Yet over the last five years, Trump has redefined the GOP. Today the party primarily judges its representatives not by any particular policy positions but by their allegiance to a defeated President and an embrace of his conspiracy theories. Stefanik has adapted. It\\u2019s a calculation that has made her a fundraising star and a party leader-in-waiting. It\\u2019s also dismayed many Republicans who have worked with and admired her in the past.  \\u201cTo be a handmaiden of Trump and get a little pat on the head from Trump is not a leadership move,\\u201d says former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA), who worked closely with Stefanik and helped organize a small, bipartisan shower in her honor ahead of her 2017 wedding. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing. It\\u2019s sad.\\u201d So how did Elise Stefanik go from praising the democratic process to standing on the House floor in the aftermath of the Capitol riot and voting to object to the Electoral College results? How did she go from saying that one particular Republican candidate was \\u201cdisqualifying themselves with untruthful statements\\u201d in 2015 to feeding vague conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden on Steve Bannon\\u2019s podcast in 2021? Her evolution mirrors the transformation of her party, while her rise within its ranks is a fall from the modern, millennial conservatism she once was on track to define.  Stefanik\\u2019s office declined to make her available to comment for this story, which is based on interviews with former colleagues, aides, friends, classmates and mentors, and draws on others I conducted with Stefanik in 2018 and 2019 for my book, The Ones We\\u2019ve Been Waiting For. Stefanik\\u2019s embrace of Trump has disappointed her high school teachers, alienated her from her alma mater and puzzled former allies and mentors who envisioned a different future for her.  \\u201cElise could have been the face of a new generation of Republicans that could represent a real big-tent party, that could build beyond the base, that could lay the foundation for a coalition that could win elections nationally,\\u201d says Margaret Hoover, a center-right commentator who worked with Stefanik at the Bush White House and now hosts PBS\\u2019s Firing Line. \\u201cIt shows that she was never motivated by principles, and that\\u2019s deeply disappointing.\\u201d Now, as her tolerance of baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election propels her toward Republican leadership, many of the people who knew her in the past are asking: what happened to Elise Stefanik? If you ask Stefanik\\u2019s childhood classmates what she was like as a girl, two words keep coming up: \\u201cintegrity\\u201d and \\u201cambition.\\u201d Growing up in upstate New York, Stefanik was friendly with Melissa DeRosa, now an embattled senior aide to scandal-plagued Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo. Both served in student government at the Albany Academy for Girls. In middle school they teamed up to pressure administrators to install a snack machine.  DeRosa grew into one of New York\\u2019s most powerful Democratic operatives as Stefanik climbed the GOP ladder. But despite their political differences, they remained close for a while. DeRosa was one of a handful of old classmates at Stefanik\\u2019s 2017 wedding. When I interviewed her about Stefanik two years ago for my book, DeRosa told me the old friends would frequently commiserate about the rough-and-tumble world of New York politics.  \\u201cThere have been times over the years when I have called her, practically in tears, saying, \\u2018This just happened, I feel so beaten down, I don\\u2019t know what to do anymore,\\u2019\\u201d DeRosa told me back then. \\u201cAnd she is so morally supportive and will be there to coach through whatever the issue is.\\u201d Somewhere along the way, Stefanik also learned to interpret criticism as evidence that she was doing something right, according to DeRosa. \\u201cShe says, \\u2018People who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you\\u2019re doing a good job,\\u201d DeRosa recalled. \\u201cHer attitude has been like: \\u2018Dig in and go the other way.\\u2019\\u201d But in February of 2021, as DeRosa took heat for the Cuomo Administration\\u2019s alleged effort to obscure the number of nursing-home deaths from COVID-19 in New York, Stefanik went nuclear. On one occasion, she tweeted that the scandal enmeshing her friend of 20 years was a \\u201ccriminal coverup,\\u201d On another, she linked to a story about about Cuomo\\u2019s senior aides, adding \\u201cPROSECUTE NOW!\\u201d  \\u201cShe sort of threw Melissa under the bus,\\u201d says Caroline Mason, the former headmistress at Albany Academy for Girls, who says she kept in touch with Stefanik for years after she graduated, exchanged Christmas cards with her until last year, and even helped preside over her 2017 wedding ceremony. Mason said she had long admired Stefanik, but that \\u201csomething stronger took hold of her.\\u201d  \\u201cShe basically abandoned her own core values for a man who had no core values,\\u201d Mason says. \\u201cHer fealty to Trump seems to have trumped her fealty to her sisters in the House.\\u201d  After high school, Stefanik went to Harvard, becoming the first in her immediate family to earn a college degree. Stefanik was one of few conservative women at Harvard\\u2019s Institute of Politics, but fellow campus politicos told me they admired her sharp reasoning, intellectual integrity and willingness to stick to her positions, even when they were unpopular on a liberal-leaning campus. She crossed paths there with Pete Buttigieg, now the U.S. Transportation Secretary, and they even met for coffee once. (Stefanik and Buttigieg both say their coffee was purely platonic, but the rumor on campus was that it was a single, uneventful date; while Buttigieg is now married to a man, he dated women in college. \\u201cPeter and Elise were at Harvard at the same time and were friends in college and once went to coffee,\\u201d a Stefanik spokesperson said. \\u201cThey did not date.\\u201d )  From Harvard, Stefanik rocketed through the traditional Republican establishment. She worked in various roles in the George W. Bush White House, then as an adviser to vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan during the 2012 presidential campaign. After that defeat, the GOP released an autopsy that argued the GOP was struggling to reach young voters, women and voters of color. Stefanik saw it as an opening to help transform her party. With support from Ryan and deep-pocketed donors, she handily won her seat in New York\\u2019s North Country to become the youngest woman elected to Congress in U.S. history. (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has since beaten that record.) When she arrived on the Hill, Stefanik was part of a cohort of young Republicans focused on helping the GOP appeal to younger, more diverse voters. With Ryan as her mentor, she staked out moderate positions on climate change and immigration consistent with her fellow conservative millennials, and pushed the GOP to recruit more women to run for office. She also built a strong record of bipartisanship. Stefanik was the 31st most bipartisan members of Congress in her first term and 19th in her second term, according to an index compiled by Georgetown University\\u2019s Lugar Center.  Stefanik tended to steer clear of hot-button right-wing issues, focusing instead on those that affected her district, like military funding and support for rural farmers. She voted against Trump\\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement\\u2014the 2017 tax cuts\\u2014because she felt they unfairly penalized high-tax states like New York. In 2017, she introduced a House resolution to commit to addressing climate change, calling environmental stewardship a \\u201cconservative principle.\\u201d  This relatively moderate record didn\\u2019t make her especially popular with Republican hard-liners. As Stefanik emerged in recent days as a top candidate to replace Cheney, the president of the conservative Club for Growth called her \\u201cvery much a liberal.\\u201d Other conservative groups, from Heritage Action to the American Conservative Union, have ranked Cheney\\u2019s record as more conservative than Stefanik\\u2019s.  But Stefanik was cultivating a reputation among colleagues as a rising star. \\u201cShe had developed a really good brand: she was the young, smart, vivacious millennial who could appeal to constituencies that Republicans had difficulty with,\\u201d says a former GOP congressman who worked closely with Stefanik. \\u201cShe had that real up-and-coming thing.\\u201d When Trump first emerged as a political phenomenon, Stefanik mostly ignored him. She said she would \\u201csupport my party\\u2019s nominee\\u201d in the 2016 election, but largely avoided mentioning him by name. From time to time, she carefully spoke out against him, adopting a tone of dutiful scolding. In August 2015, she said in a radio interview that Trump had been \\u201cinsulting to women\\u201d and said his campaign had \\u201churt the effort\\u201d to reach out to them. After Trump\\u2019s Access Hollywood scandal, she said his \\u201cinappropriate, offensive comments are just wrong.\\u201d When Trump moved to ban travel from some Muslim-majority countries, she said she opposed his \\u201crushed and overly broad Executive Order.\\u201d She said she didn\\u2019t think his plans for a border wall were \\u201crealistic\\u201d and that the President \\u201cwasn\\u2019t exactly right on that.\\u201d When Trump blasted immigrants from \\u201csh-thole countries,\\u201d Stefanik released a statement that the comments were \\u201cwrong and contrary to our American ideals.\\u201d  But as Trump\\u2019s presidency wore on, Stefanik\\u2019s party transformed. So did her district, which voted twice for Obama before breaking heavily for Trump. \\u201cIt\\u2019s only become more and more supportive of President Trump over time,\\u201d Stefanik said on Bannon\\u2019s podcast. \\u201cI represent farmers, manufacturers, and hardworking families who want someone who stands up for them, and President Trump spoke to those people.\\u201d  \\u201cIf you\\u2019re looking for a through line, it\\u2019s that her district has changed and she\\u2019s always been attuned to what her district wants,\\u201d says Brendan Buck, a former top aide to Speaker Ryan. \\u201cA swing purple district got a middle-of-the-road moderate member, and now it is a Trumpy district, and they have a Trumpy representative.\\u201d  It\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when Stefanik\\u2019s own evolution began. Some suspect it started in August of 2018, when Trump joined Stefanik for a visit to Fort Drum, a key military base in her district. \\u201cYou\\u2019re standing in front of a crowd, and all of a sudden you see there\\u2019s a bigger crowd than you normally would have,\\u201d says one former Republican Congresswoman who recalled that event.  Others point out that the political downsides of anti-Trumpism became clear around the same time. In the 2018 midterms, many Republicans who had criticized Trump lost their seats. Among them was Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a close friend of Stefanik\\u2019s who had been outspoken in his opposition to Trump\\u2019s immigration policy.  Still others see a substantive reason for the change. Stefanik sat on the Intelligence Committee during the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While former FBI chief Robert Mueller found widespread evidence of bad behavior by Trump and others, including repeated testimony showing Trump obstructed justice, the Intelligence Committee, and later the Department of Justice Inspector General, found evidence of inappropriate investigative measures by the FBI and others. Over the course of the Russia probe, Stefanik became an outspoken defender of the President, arguing that he was being unfairly persecuted by Democrats. \\u201cThe longer she served on Intelligence, the more she pivoted towards defending the Administration,\\u201d says a former GOP member of Congress. Then came Trump\\u2019s 2019 impeachment trial on charges he solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. That\\u2019s when a switch flipped, according to a former aide to GOP House leadership. Stefanik was named a member of Trump\\u2019s impeachment defense team and emerged as a vehement advocate, earning favorable press on Fox News and praise from the President himself. \\u201cShe became a darling of the right and an enemy of the left,\\u201d says a former Republican Congressman who knew her well. \\u201cAnd she just decided to own that and monetized it.\\u201d  In the last three months of 2019, Stefanik raised a whopping $3.2 million\\u2014a seven-fold increase from the previous quarter\\u2019s haul\\u2014making her the second-highest fundraiser in the House. She had picked her side. \\u201cShe has become a star,\\u201d Trump gushed on Fox \u0026 Friends. Stefanik soon became the co-chair of Trump\\u2019s re-election campaign in New York. She gave a rousing speech at the 2020 GOP Convention about \\u201cthe Democrats\\u2019 baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media\\u2019s endless obsession with it.\\u201d  \\u201cThis attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you: your voice, and your vote,\\u201d she added. \\u201cOur support for President Trump is stronger than ever before.\\u201d This would be the basis of her defense of Trump before, during, and after the 2020 election. Her constituents were Trump\\u2019s voters, and they perceived any attack on Trump to be an attack on them. \\u201cI think all of this is very genuine to her,\\u201d says Anthony Pileggi, a former top aide for Stefanik from the beginning of her Congressional career. \\u201cI think this is someone who is a very hardworking member of Congress, who saw that the president was being attacked during impeachment.\\u201d Others see it differently. \\u201cTrump has won the Republican Party. Trump owns it. It is the key to her re-elections, it is the key to her fundraising, it\\u2019s the key to her advancement within Congress,\\u201d says Hoover. \\u201cShe knows how to play it, so that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. Never mind that it\\u2019s undermining democracy. She\\u2019s made a calculation that she can rise to power by backing the Big Lie.\\u201d  In the aftermath of Biden\\u2019s victory in the 2020 election, Stefanik stopped short of adopting Trump\\u2019s false claims that the election was \\u201crigged\\u2019 or \\u201cstolen.\\u201d But she perpetuated the baseless claims around the election outcome.  In a Newsmax interview a month after the election, she parroted conspiracy theories about \\u201cirregularities,\\u201d then mentioned she had \\u201cconcerns\\u201d about \\u201cDominion software,\\u201d indirectly alluding to a false conspiracy theory that the voting-machine company had been part of an effort to rig the election against Trump. (Officials from Trump\\u2019s Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that \\u201cthere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\\u201d and Dominion has filed several lawsuits against people and organizations that spread the conspiracy theory, including one that forced Newsmax to retract its claims and apologize.) In December, Stefanik was one of 126 Republicans who signed onto an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to consider rejecting election results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. She then announced in an open letter to her constituents that she would object to electors from the same four states. Amid the insurrection, when House Republicans forced a vote on only two states, Stefanik voted to certify Biden\\u2019s win in Arizona but reject his win in Pennsylvania. She continued to make baseless claims about \\u201cvoting irregularities\\u201d and \\u201clack of ballot integrity and security,\\u201d though no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud ever emerged. (Harvard, her beloved alma mater, stripped her from the Senior Advisory Council of the Institute of Politics after she voted to challenge the election results.) Some people who know Stefanik said she may have cultivated genuine concerns about election integrity, given that votes were cast under the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic and the race was extremely close in some states. On Bannon\\u2019s podcast, she said she was concerned about \\u201cunprecedented, unconstitutional overreach\\u201d and \\u201cunelected judges and bureaucrats who were rewriting election laws in real time,\\u201d and raised questions about a \\u201clack of chain of custody\\u201d for ballots. Her aides say she is simply representing the concerns of the millions of Americans who don\\u2019t believe the election was fair, including her constituents, who voted for Trump by a wide margin. But no one I spoke to inside or outside her office believes she actually thinks the election was stolen.

of Terror' Slur. There\\u2019s never a good time for TV companies to offend advertisers but, in a week in which media companies have seen Wall Street fears for their business model wipe tens of billions of dollars off their value, Time Warner Inc\\u2019s CNN hardly needed this. Kenya is pulling out of a contract with the channel after taking offense at being called a \\u2018hotbed of terror\\u2019 during CNN\\u2019s new coverage of President Barack Obama\\u2019s recent visit to Africa. (Obama himself had hardly pulled his punches while in the country, slamming its corruption, its repression of homosexuals and its poor treatment of women.) According to the website Business Daily Africa, the Kenyan Tourism Board, a state agency that markets its internationally renowned safari and beach holidays, said it was reacting to \\u201cmisrepresentation of the country\\u2019s status.\\u201d \\u201cSome narrative adverts were already running on CNN as we planned launch of above-the-line TV campaigns with them but we suspended all of that,\\u201d BDA quoted chief executive Muriithi Ndegwa as saying on Thursday. Tourism Secretary Phyllis Kandie had engaged CNN on a one-year deal to help revive a sector that is struggling after a surge in political instability over the last couple of years. The trouble is, Kenya\\u2019s problems with terrorism-like the beauty of its tourist attractions\\u2013are all too real. Flag carrier Kenyan Airways posted the country\\u2019s biggest ever corporate loss two weeks ago, on the back of a 25% year-on-year drop in tourist arrivals in the first five months of the year. Tourist visits, a key source of foreign exchange for the country, have fallen for the last three years running (although the Kenyan Shilling has fared a lot better against a resurgent dollar than many other emerging currencies in that time). The Somalia-based Islamic terrorist group Al Shabaab has contributed much to that, having launched a string of attacks inside Kenya since 2012 in response to Kenya\\u2019s deployment of troops in neighboring Somalia. A 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya\\u2019s capital Nairobi by Al Shabaab-associated gunmen killed 130 people, grabbing global headlines. In an even more gruesome attack this April, terrorists killed 148 people, mainly students, at the Garissa University College. This article originally appeared on Fortune.com \",\n          \"Alabama Ruling May Disenfranchise Thousands. Jenny Lux didn\\u2019t want to risk her life to vote. Her acute respiratory distress syndrome puts her at a high risk for dangerous complications related to COVID-19, compelling her to take quarantine seriously. So when the 39-year-old read Alabama\\u2019s requirements for voting by mail this election cycle, she was stunned. While Alabamians no longer needed to give a reason for requesting a mail-in absentee ballot, they still need to either have their mail ballot notarized or witnessed by two adults simultaneously, as well as include a copy of their photo ID when applying for the ballot. Lux lives alone with her 17-year-old son, and suddenly faced an impossible choice: either risk COVID-19 exposure at a notary service or and allow two adults into her home to witness her ballot. \\u201cMy reaction [was], \\u2018Wow, really? You\\u2019re going to do this to me?\\u2019\\u201d she says. \\u201cI just can\\u2019t risk it. It\\u2019s life and death that we\\u2019re talking about here\\u2026 Why should I jump through all these hoops?\\u201d  Lux considered other options, including curbside voting, which many states have adopted this year amid COVID-19. But while Alabama law does not prohibit the service, the state has gone to great lengths to prevent counties from offering it this year. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said explicitly that curbside voting would not be allowed under the state\\u2019s law. On Oct. 21, the Supreme Court ruled that Alabama\\u2019s de facto ban on curbside voting could stand, reversing a lower court\\u2019s ruling that the restriction violated the Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was the latest instance of a conservative court upholding Republican-backed voting restrictions in the final weeks before Election Day. That court decision, combined with Alabama\\u2019s requirements that mail ballots be notarized or witnessed, and include a copy of an ID with the application, collectively create an extremely high burden to vote amid the pandemic\\u2014particularly for disabled, elderly and other high-risk people.  \\u201cAlabama voters are going to have to decide whether they want to vote in person or not vote at all because some of them will have a very difficult time complying with the absentee ballot requirements,\\u201d says Sarah H. Brannon, a managing attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\\u2019s (ACLU) Voting Rights Project, which helped bring the suit against Alabama\\u2019s rules.  In May, several Alabama voters challenged the state\\u2019s de facto ban on curbside voting, as well as its witness and voter ID requirements, arguing that the rules posed a threat to their health. In September, a federal district court agreed with the plaintiffs, ordering Alabama to allow curbside voting and suspending the witness and ID rules for elderly voters or those with underlying medical conditions. Alabama appealed the case and earlier this month, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals handed Alabama Republicans the victory: the appellate court reversed the lower court decision, reinstating the witness and ID requirements.  The court drama continued. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling left open the option that counties could offer curbside voting, and two of the state\\u2019s most populous counties\\u2014Jefferson County and Montgomery County\\u2014took steps to implement the service. But Alabama appealed again and the Supreme Court decided in its favor. Curbside voting will not be an option for Alabama voters this year. After the prolonged litigation battle, Alabama voters who are disabled, elderly or have underlying conditions were back where they started: deciding whether to put their health at risk to fulfill the witness and ID requirements or vote in person\\u2014or not vote at all. \\u201cNobody should have to make a decision between being able to vote and protecting yourself from COVID-19,\\u201d says Michelle Bishop, voting rights specialist at the National Disability Rights Network. Lux, who is legally blind, is a member of the disability rights advocate group People First of Alabama, the plaintiff in the suit, and testified in the trial. \\u201cI know if I\\u2019m affected by it, there are thousands others like me affected,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fight for social justice.\\u201d Read More: Here\\u2019s Everything You Need to Know About Voting Americans with disabilities and chronic illnesses have already been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And as they prepared to vote this year, many found that their states\\u2019 procedures did not take into account their needs, prompting cases like this around the country. Voters with disabilities sued in North Carolina, Virginia and Texas, and advocates sued South Carolina over a witness requirement for absentee ballots in that state. In Alabama, where coronavirus cases have been on the rise, the issue is particularly acute. The state has a history of voter suppression and a high proportion of Black and disabled voters, all of whom are disproportionately affected by both the pandemic and voting rights issues. There are 748,000 eligible voters with disabilities in Alabama, representing 20% of the state\\u2019s electorate, according to data from researchers Douglas Kruse and Lisa Schur at Rutgers University. Alabama\\u2019s population is among the highest risk for heart disease, stroke and has the highest rate of diabetes in the country. Over 40% of its coronavirus deaths have been people with diabetes. Many high-risk voters are taking the threat seriously. Tonja Leath, 57, usually votes by mail from her home in Hoover, Ala. because of a disability that makes it difficult for her to stand for long periods of time. But when she realized she would still need to fulfill the witness and photo ID requirements during the pandemic, she was frustrated. \\u201cWhy with this election? It does not make any sense. They\\u2019re inconveniencing people, especially the disabled and the elderly,\\u201d she says. Leath says she wishes her county offered curbside voting. In Montgomery, 37-year-old Terri Flowers has also been trying to stay home because her daughter has asthma. Flowers has decided to have her daughter attend school virtually for the foreseeable future to protect her from any exposure to the virus. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m going to keep her from going to school because of [the virus],\\u201d she says, \\u201cit doesn\\u2019t make sense for me to go out and be exposed to COVID and potentially bring it back to her.\\u201d  To avoid concerns about voting by mail, both Leath and Flowers decided to vote \\u201cin-person absentee,\\u201d a process that allowed them to go to their absentee ballot manager\\u2019s office, apply for an absentee ballot in person, fill out their absentee ballot and then have it notarized. While they made their situations work, not all voters will be able to do so, as the method still requires voters to risk COVID-19 exposure at their absentee ballot manager\\u2019s office, which can be difficult to access for disabled or rural voters. The other state requirement for voting by mail\\u2014that Alabama residents include a copy of their photo ID in their ballot application\\u2014can also present obstacles for lower income voters who might not have regular internet access or printers at home. Alabama argued that the laws in question were necessary to prevent voter fraud and preserve confidence in the upcoming election. It also said that the restrictions did not place an undue burden on the plaintiffs. \\u201cThe photo ID and witness requirements are necessary deterrents for those looking to commit voter fraud, and I am glad the 11th Circuit has recognized their importance in safeguarding the elections process,\\u201d Merrill said in an Oct. 13 statement. Evidence has repeatedly shown that voter fraud in the U.S. is nearly nonexistent.  Caren Short, a senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which jointly filed the suit against Alabama, says the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling allowing the vote-by-mail laws to stand \\u201cdemonstrates part of a trend where unfortunately more conservative state election officials are leaning heavily on the myth of voter fraud to justify onerous and unnecessary restrictions on voting to essentially suppress votes.\\u201d  Maia Fleischman, a voting rights fellow with the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), which also jointly filed the suit, adds that while she found the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling disappointing, it \\u201cpretty much aligned with what we\\u2019ve been seeing in the courts the last month.\\u201d She said that, in her opinion, the group chose not to appeal the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling on the absentee ballot laws after looking at how the Supreme Court has ruled in similar voting rights cases this year. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t also want to make things harder for voting rights cases in the future,\\u201d she says. She added, \\u201cWe decided to focus our on the argument that the curbside voting ban is unconstitutional and it is a proper ADA accommodation. We think curbside voting would have benefited thousands of Alabamians this upcoming election day in light of COVID-19.\\u201d The Supreme Court did not offer an opinion explaining its decision to stay the 11th Circuit\\u2019s ruling this week, and only the three liberal justices dissented. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\u2019s death last month, the Supreme Court now has a conservative majority, and if President Donald Trump\\u2019s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed as expected, that will cement the court\\u2019s rightward tilt. Trump has also appointed roughly a quarter of all federal appeals court judges during his time in office, meaning that cases are now more likely to be heard by conservative judges on appeal.  Disability and voting rights advocates say that impact of a conservative-leaning bench will affect civil rights litigation long past Nov. 3. \\u201cWe have to file cases at the trial level, because voting is a constitutional right and the foundation of our democracy,\\u201d says Christina Brandt-Young, a managing attorney at Disability Rights Advocates, which signed onto an amicus brief in the Alabama case. \\u201cBut if appeals are less and less attractive, that will push us back into other kinds of advocacy.\\u201d After much deliberation, Lux was able to vote this year. She found a notary who was willing to come to her house, wear a mask, and certify her ballot, so she didn\\u2019t have to risk a trip to the county elections office. She\\u2019s since mailed her ballot and received a notification that it was received. But the process left a bitter taste in her mouth. \\u201cI feel marginalized,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being swept under the rug.\\u201d She also recognizes that many voters won\\u2019t be able to find the same work-around like she did. As Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in her dissent on the high court\\u2019s ruling, one of the plaintiffs, Howard Porter, Jr.\\u2014a Black man in his 70s with both asthma and Parkinson\\u2019s Disease\\u2014described the state voting restrictions as a question of life or death.  \\u201c\\u2018[S]o many of my [ancestors] even died to vote,\\u201d Porter testified before the lower court. \\u201cAnd while I don\\u2019t mind dying to vote, I think we\\u2019re past that\\u2014we\\u2019re past that time.\\u2019\\u201d  \",\n          \"How Elise Stefanik Went From Moderate to MAGA. When Elise Stefanik was elected to the House of Representatives in 2014, she was hailed as the fresh face of the new GOP. Stefanik had run for office in her 20s, determined to modernize the Republican Party to attract more women and appeal to her fellow millennials. In her victory speech, she praised her opponents for their good-faith participation in the miracle of American democracy. \\u201cNo matter their party, our democratic process is strengthened by those individuals willing to put forth their ideas,\\u201d she said on the night she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.  Today Stefanik is still a politician on the rise, but for very different reasons. As soon as next week, she is widely expected to ascend to the position of House GOP conference chair, which would make her the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress. And she will have gotten there by lashing herself to a cause that undermines the same democratic process she once hoped to strengthen.  The opening for Stefanik to become the No. 3 House Republican has been created by the anticipated ouster of Rep. Liz Cheney, who has lost the support of her colleagues for insisting the party stop parroting President Donald Trump\\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Rejecting Trump\\u2019s fictions about a stolen election is enough to make Cheney, a rock-ribbed conservative and daughter of a former vice president, an outcast in today\\u2019s GOP. \\u201cElise Stefanik is a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair,\\u201d Trump said in a statement. To replace Cheney with Stefanik would send a powerful signal: that anyone who refuses to carry water for Trump\\u2019s conspiracy theories cannot carry the Republican mantle.  But Elise Stefanik is no Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene. She was not always a MAGA warrior. Not long ago, she was a widely respected moderate Republican known for her embrace of facts, her trust in science and her push to build a more diverse party, highlighted by her successful efforts to recruit more GOP women to run for office. She was a prominent member of the moderate Tuesday Group, a caucus of center-right Republicans. And she was widely credited for a bipartisan spirit\\u2014\\u201devery Democrat\\u2019s favorite Republican,\\u201d as one former aide to GOP leadership puts it now. Yet over the last five years, Trump has redefined the GOP. Today the party primarily judges its representatives not by any particular policy positions but by their allegiance to a defeated President and an embrace of his conspiracy theories. Stefanik has adapted. It\\u2019s a calculation that has made her a fundraising star and a party leader-in-waiting. It\\u2019s also dismayed many Republicans who have worked with and admired her in the past.  \\u201cTo be a handmaiden of Trump and get a little pat on the head from Trump is not a leadership move,\\u201d says former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA), who worked closely with Stefanik and helped organize a small, bipartisan shower in her honor ahead of her 2017 wedding. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing. It\\u2019s sad.\\u201d So how did Elise Stefanik go from praising the democratic process to standing on the House floor in the aftermath of the Capitol riot and voting to object to the Electoral College results? How did she go from saying that one particular Republican candidate was \\u201cdisqualifying themselves with untruthful statements\\u201d in 2015 to feeding vague conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden on Steve Bannon\\u2019s podcast in 2021? Her evolution mirrors the transformation of her party, while her rise within its ranks is a fall from the modern, millennial conservatism she once was on track to define.  Stefanik\\u2019s office declined to make her available to comment for this story, which is based on interviews with former colleagues, aides, friends, classmates and mentors, and draws on others I conducted with Stefanik in 2018 and 2019 for my book, The Ones We\\u2019ve Been Waiting For. Stefanik\\u2019s embrace of Trump has disappointed her high school teachers, alienated her from her alma mater and puzzled former allies and mentors who envisioned a different future for her.  \\u201cElise could have been the face of a new generation of Republicans that could represent a real big-tent party, that could build beyond the base, that could lay the foundation for a coalition that could win elections nationally,\\u201d says Margaret Hoover, a center-right commentator who worked with Stefanik at the Bush White House and now hosts PBS\\u2019s Firing Line. \\u201cIt shows that she was never motivated by principles, and that\\u2019s deeply disappointing.\\u201d Now, as her tolerance of baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election propels her toward Republican leadership, many of the people who knew her in the past are asking: what happened to Elise Stefanik? If you ask Stefanik\\u2019s childhood classmates what she was like as a girl, two words keep coming up: \\u201cintegrity\\u201d and \\u201cambition.\\u201d Growing up in upstate New York, Stefanik was friendly with Melissa DeRosa, now an embattled senior aide to scandal-plagued Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo. Both served in student government at the Albany Academy for Girls. In middle school they teamed up to pressure administrators to install a snack machine.  DeRosa grew into one of New York\\u2019s most powerful Democratic operatives as Stefanik climbed the GOP ladder. But despite their political differences, they remained close for a while. DeRosa was one of a handful of old classmates at Stefanik\\u2019s 2017 wedding. When I interviewed her about Stefanik two years ago for my book, DeRosa told me the old friends would frequently commiserate about the rough-and-tumble world of New York politics.  \\u201cThere have been times over the years when I have called her, practically in tears, saying, \\u2018This just happened, I feel so beaten down, I don\\u2019t know what to do anymore,\\u2019\\u201d DeRosa told me back then. \\u201cAnd she is so morally supportive and will be there to coach through whatever the issue is.\\u201d Somewhere along the way, Stefanik also learned to interpret criticism as evidence that she was doing something right, according to DeRosa. \\u201cShe says, \\u2018People who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you\\u2019re doing a good job,\\u201d DeRosa recalled. \\u201cHer attitude has been like: \\u2018Dig in and go the other way.\\u2019\\u201d But in February of 2021, as DeRosa took heat for the Cuomo Administration\\u2019s alleged effort to obscure the number of nursing-home deaths from COVID-19 in New York, Stefanik went nuclear. On one occasion, she tweeted that the scandal enmeshing her friend of 20 years was a \\u201ccriminal coverup,\\u201d On another, she linked to a story about about Cuomo\\u2019s senior aides, adding \\u201cPROSECUTE NOW!\\u201d  \\u201cShe sort of threw Melissa under the bus,\\u201d says Caroline Mason, the former headmistress at Albany Academy for Girls, who says she kept in touch with Stefanik for years after she graduated, exchanged Christmas cards with her until last year, and even helped preside over her 2017 wedding ceremony. Mason said she had long admired Stefanik, but that \\u201csomething stronger took hold of her.\\u201d  \\u201cShe basically abandoned her own core values for a man who had no core values,\\u201d Mason says. \\u201cHer fealty to Trump seems to have trumped her fealty to her sisters in the House.\\u201d  After high school, Stefanik went to Harvard, becoming the first in her immediate family to earn a college degree. Stefanik was one of few conservative women at Harvard\\u2019s Institute of Politics, but fellow campus politicos told me they admired her sharp reasoning, intellectual integrity and willingness to stick to her positions, even when they were unpopular on a liberal-leaning campus. She crossed paths there with Pete Buttigieg, now the U.S. Transportation Secretary, and they even met for coffee once. (Stefanik and Buttigieg both say their coffee was purely platonic, but the rumor on campus was that it was a single, uneventful date; while Buttigieg is now married to a man, he dated women in college. \\u201cPeter and Elise were at Harvard at the same time and were friends in college and once went to coffee,\\u201d a Stefanik spokesperson said. \\u201cThey did not date.\\u201d )  From Harvard, Stefanik rocketed through the traditional Republican establishment. She worked in various roles in the George W. Bush White House, then as an adviser to vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan during the 2012 presidential campaign. After that defeat, the GOP released an autopsy that argued the GOP was struggling to reach young voters, women and voters of color. Stefanik saw it as an opening to help transform her party. With support from Ryan and deep-pocketed donors, she handily won her seat in New York\\u2019s North Country to become the youngest woman elected to Congress in U.S. history. (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has since beaten that record.) When she arrived on the Hill, Stefanik was part of a cohort of young Republicans focused on helping the GOP appeal to younger, more diverse voters. With Ryan as her mentor, she staked out moderate positions on climate change and immigration consistent with her fellow conservative millennials, and pushed the GOP to recruit more women to run for office. She also built a strong record of bipartisanship. Stefanik was the 31st most bipartisan members of Congress in her first term and 19th in her second term, according to an index compiled by Georgetown University\\u2019s Lugar Center.  Stefanik tended to steer clear of hot-button right-wing issues, focusing instead on those that affected her district, like military funding and support for rural farmers. She voted against Trump\\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement\\u2014the 2017 tax cuts\\u2014because she felt they unfairly penalized high-tax states like New York. In 2017, she introduced a House resolution to commit to addressing climate change, calling environmental stewardship a \\u201cconservative principle.\\u201d  This relatively moderate record didn\\u2019t make her especially popular with Republican hard-liners. As Stefanik emerged in recent days as a top candidate to replace Cheney, the president of the conservative Club for Growth called her \\u201cvery much a liberal.\\u201d Other conservative groups, from Heritage Action to the American Conservative Union, have ranked Cheney\\u2019s record as more conservative than Stefanik\\u2019s.  But Stefanik was cultivating a reputation among colleagues as a rising star. \\u201cShe had developed a really good brand: she was the young, smart, vivacious millennial who could appeal to constituencies that Republicans had difficulty with,\\u201d says a former GOP congressman who worked closely with Stefanik. \\u201cShe had that real up-and-coming thing.\\u201d When Trump first emerged as a political phenomenon, Stefanik mostly ignored him. She said she would \\u201csupport my party\\u2019s nominee\\u201d in the 2016 election, but largely avoided mentioning him by name. From time to time, she carefully spoke out against him, adopting a tone of dutiful scolding. In August 2015, she said in a radio interview that Trump had been \\u201cinsulting to women\\u201d and said his campaign had \\u201churt the effort\\u201d to reach out to them. After Trump\\u2019s Access Hollywood scandal, she said his \\u201cinappropriate, offensive comments are just wrong.\\u201d When Trump moved to ban travel from some Muslim-majority countries, she said she opposed his \\u201crushed and overly broad Executive Order.\\u201d She said she didn\\u2019t think his plans for a border wall were \\u201crealistic\\u201d and that the President \\u201cwasn\\u2019t exactly right on that.\\u201d When Trump blasted immigrants from \\u201csh-thole countries,\\u201d Stefanik released a statement that the comments were \\u201cwrong and contrary to our American ideals.\\u201d  But as Trump\\u2019s presidency wore on, Stefanik\\u2019s party transformed. So did her district, which voted twice for Obama before breaking heavily for Trump. \\u201cIt\\u2019s only become more and more supportive of President Trump over time,\\u201d Stefanik said on Bannon\\u2019s podcast. \\u201cI represent farmers, manufacturers, and hardworking families who want someone who stands up for them, and President Trump spoke to those people.\\u201d  \\u201cIf you\\u2019re looking for a through line, it\\u2019s that her district has changed and she\\u2019s always been attuned to what her district wants,\\u201d says Brendan Buck, a former top aide to Speaker Ryan. \\u201cA swing purple district got a middle-of-the-road moderate member, and now it is a Trumpy district, and they have a Trumpy representative.\\u201d  It\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when Stefanik\\u2019s own evolution began. Some suspect it started in August of 2018, when Trump joined Stefanik for a visit to Fort Drum, a key military base in her district. \\u201cYou\\u2019re standing in front of a crowd, and all of a sudden you see there\\u2019s a bigger crowd than you normally would have,\\u201d says one former Republican Congresswoman who recalled that event.  Others point out that the political downsides of anti-Trumpism became clear around the same time. In the 2018 midterms, many Republicans who had criticized Trump lost their seats. Among them was Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a close friend of Stefanik\\u2019s who had been outspoken in his opposition to Trump\\u2019s immigration policy.  Still others see a substantive reason for the change. Stefanik sat on the Intelligence Committee during the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While former FBI chief Robert Mueller found widespread evidence of bad behavior by Trump and others, including repeated testimony showing Trump obstructed justice, the Intelligence Committee, and later the Department of Justice Inspector General, found evidence of inappropriate investigative measures by the FBI and others. Over the course of the Russia probe, Stefanik became an outspoken defender of the President, arguing that he was being unfairly persecuted by Democrats. \\u201cThe longer she served on Intelligence, the more she pivoted towards defending the Administration,\\u201d says a former GOP member of Congress. Then came Trump\\u2019s 2019 impeachment trial on charges he solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. That\\u2019s when a switch flipped, according to a former aide to GOP House leadership. Stefanik was named a member of Trump\\u2019s impeachment defense team and emerged as a vehement advocate, earning favorable press on Fox News and praise from the President himself. \\u201cShe became a darling of the right and an enemy of the left,\\u201d says a former Republican Congressman who knew her well. \\u201cAnd she just decided to own that and monetized it.\\u201d  In the last three months of 2019, Stefanik raised a whopping $3.2 million\\u2014a seven-fold increase from the previous quarter\\u2019s haul\\u2014making her the second-highest fundraiser in the House. She had picked her side. \\u201cShe has become a star,\\u201d Trump gushed on Fox \u0026 Friends. Stefanik soon became the co-chair of Trump\\u2019s re-election campaign in New York. She gave a rousing speech at the 2020 GOP Convention about \\u201cthe Democrats\\u2019 baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media\\u2019s endless obsession with it.\\u201d  \\u201cThis attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you: your voice, and your vote,\\u201d she added. \\u201cOur support for President Trump is stronger than ever before.\\u201d This would be the basis of her defense of Trump before, during, and after the 2020 election. Her constituents were Trump\\u2019s voters, and they perceived any attack on Trump to be an attack on them. \\u201cI think all of this is very genuine to her,\\u201d says Anthony Pileggi, a former top aide for Stefanik from the beginning of her Congressional career. \\u201cI think this is someone who is a very hardworking member of Congress, who saw that the president was being attacked during impeachment.\\u201d Others see it differently. \\u201cTrump has won the Republican Party. Trump owns it. It is the key to her re-elections, it is the key to her fundraising, it\\u2019s the key to her advancement within Congress,\\u201d says Hoover. \\u201cShe knows how to play it, so that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. Never mind that it\\u2019s undermining democracy. She\\u2019s made a calculation that she can rise to power by backing the Big Lie.\\u201d  In the aftermath of Biden\\u2019s victory in the 2020 election, Stefanik stopped short of adopting Trump\\u2019s false claims that the election was \\u201crigged\\u2019 or \\u201cstolen.\\u201d But she perpetuated the baseless claims around the election outcome.  In a Newsmax interview a month after the election, she parroted conspiracy theories about \\u201cirregularities,\\u201d then mentioned she had \\u201cconcerns\\u201d about \\u201cDominion software,\\u201d indirectly alluding to a false conspiracy theory that the voting-machine company had been part of an effort to rig the election against Trump. (Officials from Trump\\u2019s Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that \\u201cthere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\\u201d and Dominion has filed several lawsuits against people and organizations that spread the conspiracy theory, including one that forced Newsmax to retract its claims and apologize.) In December, Stefanik was one of 126 Republicans who signed onto an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to consider rejecting election results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. She then announced in an open letter to her constituents that she would object to electors from the same four states. Amid the insurrection, when House Republicans forced a vote on only two states, Stefanik voted to certify Biden\\u2019s win in Arizona but reject his win in Pennsylvania. She continued to make baseless claims about \\u201cvoting irregularities\\u201d and \\u201clack of ballot integrity and security,\\u201d though no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud ever emerged. (Harvard, her beloved alma mater, stripped her from the Senior Advisory Council of the Institute of Politics after she voted to challenge the election results.) Some people who know Stefanik said she may have cultivated genuine concerns about election integrity, given that votes were cast under the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic and the race was extremely close in some states. On Bannon\\u2019s podcast, she said she was concerned about \\u201cunprecedented, unconstitutional overreach\\u201d and \\u201cunelected judges and bureaucrats who were rewriting election laws in real time,\\u201d and raised questions about a \\u201clack of chain of custody\\u201d for ballots. Her aides say she is simply representing the concerns of the millions of Americans who don\\u2019t believe the election was fair, including her constituents, who voted for Trump by a wide margin. But no one I spoke to inside or outside her office believes she actually thinks the election was stolen. When asked directly, aides often pivot to \\u201cconcerns\\u201d about \\u201cirregularities.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t even know if she believes the Big Lie,\\u201d says Hoover, Stefanik\\u2019s former colleague. \\u201cBut she is absolutely responsible for propagating a lie that will undermine our democracy.\\u201d  Whether she believes the lies or not, Stefanik has now aligned herself with Trump for good.
